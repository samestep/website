          <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> is a modern alternative to
          <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>. I've been
          interested in it for a while: it promises to be both more
          user-friendly and <em>far</em> more performant than LaTeX.
          Unfortunately, though, it'll probably be quite some time before it's a
          real option for academic publishing in computer science.
          <a href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/faq/whytex.html"
            >arXiv requires TeX source code</a
          >, as do many conferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          But today I had an excuse to try it out: I'm not required to use TeX
          for my
          <a href="https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu/Student%20Resources/index.html"
            >thesis proposal</a
          >! What better way to procrastinate than by trying a new tool?
          Actually, I've gone through the
          <a href="https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/">Typst tutorial</a> before,
          but I forgot everything since then, so I still count this as a first
          impression.

        <h2>The good</h2>
        <p>
          It's so easy to just get started writing: unlike LaTeX, you can just
          type in a completely empty file and those words will show up
          immediately in the rendered document. And obviously the near-instant
          rendering speed is just night and day compared to every LaTeX engine
          I've used.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've never considered myself &quot;good at&quot; TeX so this is
          probably just a skill issue, but I found it quite easy to getting some
          basic formatting going (e.g. for the first page of a thesis proposal),
          since the syntax feels familiar (kinda similar to Markdown) and is
          generally lighter-weight than LaTeX.
        </p>
        <p>
          There seems to be some pretty smart behavior for automatically
          scrolling the rendered view to where you're typing. For instance, I
          was looking at the autogenerated table of contents, and I added a new
          <code>#pagebreak()</code> and section heading at the bottom of the
          document; the view stayed where it was and continuously updated as I
          typed the section title. Then when I hit Enter and started typing the
          section <em>contents</em>, it immediately scrolled down to the bottom
          of the document.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              I tested this further by going back and forth between typing in a
              couple different sections, and I noticed that it only jumped when
              I typed a non-whitespace character. At first I thought this was
              because it only jumps on a &quot;visible&quot; change, but then I
              realized that's not the case: I tried typing an extra space in the
              middle of a sentence, and it still jumped even though that space
              didn't appear in the rendered output. So I guess it just trims
              whitespace from the end of a paragraph.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Interestingly, it only seems to jump when adding characters, not
              when deleting them.
            </p>

                >Unlike <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, I
                don't see a button you can just click to scroll the rendered
                output to the point corresponding to a location in the source.
                This doesn't really matter though, since you can just type in
                the source to make it automatically scroll.</s

              Edit (Cinco de Mayo 2025): apparently there is actually a
              &quot;Scroll preview to cursor position&quot; button. Not sure if
              they added it recently or if I just missed it before.

          Just like with LaTeX, you can click on a reference number to jump to
          the corresponding bibliography item. I kind of wish there were a
          keyboard shortcut to jump back (similar to
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_go-to-definition"
            ><code>^-</code> in VS Code</a
          >), but again, I can achieve that by just typing in the source.
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <a
            href="https://github.com/typst/hayagriva/blob/a9d855b5c50723f697a1173f2d58bc7d822b6fbc/docs/file-format.md"
            >&quot;Hayagriva&quot; YAML-based bibliography format</a
          >
          seems fine. It's nice to have an actually-machine-readable data
          format. Plenty of people have their gripes with YAML, but personally I
          don't mind it.
        </p>
        <h2>The bad</h2>
        <p>
          The dictionary is case-sensitive which I think is generally good, but
          in this case that actually becomes bad because it's limited to 100
          words. It's not even sorted, which seems absurd! There's a
          <a href="https://github.com/typst/webapp-issues/issues/338"
            >GitHub issue</a
          >
          about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a bit annoying to debug parse errors in the bibliography YAML.
          For instance, one paper's title had a colon in it (a fairly common
          occurrence), and the error message said &quot;Failed to parse YAML
          (mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 3 column
          14)&quot;, which <em>is</em> the right location for the error in my
          actual <code>refs.yml</code> file; but the error message says it comes
          from <code>main.typ</code>, and after that message it says &quot;(line
          73)&quot; which is just the line number for the
          <code>#bibliography</code> command at the end of my
          <code>main.typ</code> file. When I click on it, it brings me there
          instead of to the actual error location in the
          <code>refs.yml</code> file. And when I go to <code>refs.yml</code>,
          there are no red squigglies at all (even though it's just a generic
          YAML parsing error), so I have to look back at the line and column
          number from the error message to locate it and fix it (by wrapping in
          double quotes).
        </p>
        <hr />

          Overall, I like it! My current prediction is that it'll be a
          relatively smooth experience for this thesis proposal. This is a
          pretty short post since I want to get comfortable with posting more
          frequently. Maybe later I'll write a followup after I've used Typst
          more.
